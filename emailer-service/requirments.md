# Emailer service requirements

These requirements might seem lacking but we are following a
lean methodology, starting with the minimum to get the feature
done and than building it up over time if needed.

### What is need to send the email

* [ ] title
* [ ] content
* [ ] address

### Questions

* does this service or another render the emails
* do we use 3rd party to manage emails
* do we store emails for auditing
